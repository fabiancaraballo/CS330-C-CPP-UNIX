CIS330: Project #1A
April 2nd, 2018


I do not know much about C programming language. My First experience of it
was in CIS 314 and we really did not go in depth with the C aspect of the class
we focused more on the assembly code stuff. C programming language did look a 
lot like java to me so reading it and being able to code C wasn't that hard.
I am very excited to learn a alot about C/C++ this term because I know a lot of 
people who always tell me how much they enjoy C/C++ once they learn it so I am 
interested to see what all the hype is about. Another reason I am excited for this class
is because near the end of last term I really started to enjoy working with linux. 
I struggled understanding why and how we use linux but once I got the hang of it
I really enjoyed working in linux and doing code in vim.
So from this class I hope to get very familiar with C/C++/Linux and hopefully get me read for 415.
Another aspect of C/C++ I am also very interesting in learning in is why it is so
different from java. For the most part it looks pretty similar to Java.
However there is some differences behind it that really intrigue me. 
For example, I always hear that C/C++/C# are all used to make video games. 
I love video games but I've always wondered what is so important about these programming
languages that allows them to write these huge AAA video games.
